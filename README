# brain_tumor_detection
This project aims to design and implement a deep learning based brain tumor detection system that would be able to detect whether a person has a brain tumor by analyzing an MRI image of the brain. The MRI image of the patient will be given as input to the system, and the deep learning model will be used to process the image and detect whether the person has a brain tumor.
